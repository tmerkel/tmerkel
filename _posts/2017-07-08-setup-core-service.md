# Setting Up an Asp.Net Core Web Service

This is more or less just a placeholder for me on the general steps I go through to create an Asp.Net Core web service and to add all the pieces that go along with it.

##Steps

### Create a new web service project

There's really not much to this...and can mostly be found doing a search on Google...but for a current reference:

From Visual Studio, select **File** menu, > **New** > **Project**.

Select the **ASP.NET Core Web Application (.NET Core)** project template.

Name the project and select **OK**.

In the **New ASP.NET Core Web Application (.NET Core) - <NameOfService>** dialog, select the **Web API** template.

Select **OK**.

Do not select **Enable Docker Support**.
